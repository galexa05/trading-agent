       "  'text': \"DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria has proposed that Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG should contemplate splitting up Google’s various businesses to enhance its overall value. This recommendation comes amid Google’s struggle to retain its supremacy in the search engine market due to the rise of AI chatbots.\\n\\nWhat Happened: Luria, in an interview with Yahoo Finance, has expressed that Google’s resistance to a breakup is contributing to its unusually low earnings multiple for a growth company. The U.S. Department of Justice has previously called on Google to divest its Chrome browser and advertising network and potentially its mobile Android division as well.\\n\\nLuria’s clients, a broad spectrum of institutional investors, are pushing for a “big bang breakup” rather than “isolated spinoffs”. Luria suggests that Google should divide its businesses into individually traded entities.\\n\\nAccording to Luria’s analysis, Google’s individual businesses would be valued much higher as separate entities. While Google’s market capitalization is currently less than $2 trillion, Luria estimates that the total value of Google’s businesses, when valued separately, would be $3.7 trillion.\\n\\nThe analyst proposes that Google should separate YouTube, Search, Google Cloud, Waymo and its AI segments. He contends that Alphabet’s stock is currently trading at a historically low valuation—just 16 times its forward earnings—significantly below the overall market multiple.\\n\\nLuria also stated that Google’s individual businesses would trade at levels comparable to their peers, with Waymo comparable to Uber UBER, Google Cloud to Snowflake SNOW, YouTube to Netflix NFLX and Google's TPU business to Nvidia NVDA.\\n\\nSEE ALSO: Mark Cuban Takes A Jab At Howard Lutnick, ‘In Which Time Share Company Is He Going To Get A Job In Sales At’\\n\\nWhy It Matters: Google’s current predicament can be traced back to May 8, when it experienced one of its worst trading days since 2023, losing over 7% and nearly $150 billion in market cap. This massive loss was triggered by a statement from Apple Inc.‘s AAPL Eddy Cue, who revealed a decline in search volume on iPhones, an event that hadn’t occurred in 20 years.\\n\\nThis revelation sparked a debate on the All-In Podcast, where venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya urged Google to stop waiting for data and start fighting models like ChatGPT.\\n\\nLuria’s “big bang breakup” is seen as a strategic suggestion for Google to regain its lost ground and boost its overall value in the face of these challenges.\\n\\nBenzinga's Edge Rankings place Alphabet in the 81st percentile for quality and the 67th percentile for growth, reflecting its strong performance in both areas.

       "  'text': \"I'm an individual investor heavily influenced by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Munger's 1994 USC Business School Speech is something I think about a lot: ### Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns 6% on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years, you're not going to make much different than a 6% return—even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with a fine result. ... Another very simple effect I very seldom see discussed either by investment managers or anybody else is the effect of taxes. If you're going to buy something which compounds for 30 years at 15% per annum and you pay one 35% tax at the very end, the way that works out is that after taxes, you keep 13.3% per annum. In contrast, if you bought the same investment, but had to pay taxes every year of 35% out of the 15% that you earned, then your return would be 15% minus 35% of 15%—or only 9.75% per year compounded. So the difference there is over 3.5%. And what 3.5% does to the numbers over long holding periods like 30 years is truly eye-opening. If you sit back for long, long stretches in great companies, you can get a huge edge from nothing but the way that income taxes work. ### Feel free to follow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/ftreric\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Apple's AAPL short percent of float has fallen 4.0% since its last report. The company recently reported that it has 108.60 million shares sold short, which is 0.72% of all regular shares that are available for trading. Based on its trading volume, it would take traders 2.29 days to cover their short positions on average.\\n\\nWhy Short Interest Matters\\n\\nShort interest is the number of shares that have been sold short but have not yet been covered or closed out. Short selling is when a trader sells shares of a company they do not own, with the hope that the price will fall. Traders make money from short selling if the price of the stock falls and they lose if it rises.\\n\\nShort interest is important to track because it can act as an indicator of market sentiment towards a particular stock. An increase in short interest can signal that investors have become more bearish, while a decrease in short interest can signal they have become more bullish.\\n\\nSee Also: List of the most shorted stocks\\n\\nApple Short Interest Graph (3 Months)\\n\\nAs you can see from the chart above the percentage of shares that are sold short for Apple has declined since its last report. This does not mean that the stock is going to rise in the near-term but traders should be aware that less shares are being shorted.\\n\\nComparing Apple's Short Interest Against Its Peers\\n\\nPeer comparison is a popular technique amongst analysts and investors for gauging how well a company is performing. A company's peer is another company that has similar characteristics to it, such as industry, size, age, and financial structure. You can find a company's peer group by reading its 10-K, proxy filing, or by doing your own similarity analysis.\\n\\nAccording to Benzinga Pro, Apple's peer group average for short interest as a percentage of float is 10.13%, which means the company has less short interest than most of its peers.\\n\\nDid you know that increasing short interest can actually be bullish for a stock? This post by Benzinga Money explains how you can profit from it.\\n\\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and was reviewed by an editor.\",\n",

Event-driven market action historically has often quickly resolved because root problems get solved. The best example of that was the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies of past incidences of equity market turnarounds such as we experienced in April, indicate that a year out markets are positive about 80 per cent of the time and the average gain is greater than a one-year average market move.\\n\\nHowever, the source of the volatility is rooted in Trump and his style, so to assume that the tariff issue and the market’s reaction in April/May was isolated ignores the cause. The next four years are likely to be more volatile than normal, so investors must make sure that their investment approach and portfolio construction can be sustained through highly emotional periods. Earnings for the first quarter have been largely positive. As of May 9, 90 per cent of S&P 500 companies had reported, with 78 per cent of companies reporting a positive earnings surprise and 62 per cent reporting a positive revenue surprise. The earnings growth rate of 13.4 per cent year-over-year would mark the second straight quarter of double-digit growth. Of course, much has happened since the first quarter period, but it is important and comforting to know that corporate America entered the turbulent tariff situation on firm footing.\\n\\nThe 12-month forward price to earnings ratio (P/E) is 20.5 times versus a five year average of 19.9 times and a ten-year average of 18.3 times from a sector standpoint. Healthcare, communication services and technology are growing the fastest annually, while energy, materials and consumer staples show negative annual comparisons. Domestic companies are growing earnings slower than foreign focused companies but are growing revenues faster, resulting in internationally focused companies expanding margins. Net profit margins remain elevated at 12.7 per cent, up from 11.8 per cent in first quarter 2024, but down from record levels of 13.9 per cent.\\n\\nMarket-moving news, fast: Get the BNN Bloomberg App now\\n\\nSign up for the Market Call Top Picks newsletter at bnnbloomberg.ca/subscribe\\n\\nTOP PICKS:\\n\\nGordon Reid's Top Picks: Elevance Health, Leonardo DRS & JPMorgan Gordon Reid, president and CEO at Goodreid Investment Counsel, shares his top stock picks to watch in the market.\\n\\nElevance Health (ELV NYSE)\\n\\nElevance, formerly named Anthem, is a managed care operator with 47 million members. The industry has been under duress as lumpy results after the pandemic and worries about government reimbursement rates pressure stock prices. ELV is trading 27 per cent below its all-time high, but more importantly its valuations are attractive, both in absolute terms and from a historical relative standpoint.\\n\\nLeonardo DRS (DRS NASD)\\n\\nDRS is an amalgam of Leonardo, an Italian defense company, RADA, an Israeli electronics company and the US based DRS, a defense concern specializing in propulsion technologies for naval equipment. With greater geo-political tension worldwide, expanding U.S. defence spending and a decoupling of NATO alliances, DRS’ backlog is growing, and business is robust.\\n\\nJPMorgan (JPM NYSE)\\n\\nJPM is best of breed.

Bulls respond by saying President Trump has managed to get China to agree to open up to American goods by removing non-monetary barriers.\\n\\nIn our analysis, prudent investors need to remember that China has been promising to open up ever since President Nixon. China has always talked a good game about opening up, but in reality, it has always maintained restrictions.\\n\\nThe chart shows the stock market remains below the breakout line after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) came cooler than expected. Here are the details: Headline CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus. Core CPI came at 0.2% vs. 0.3% consensus.\\n\\nIn our analysis the probabilities of stagflation and recession have decreased. The reason is the great deal China secured on tariffs. On the campaign trail, President Trump had promised 60% tariffs on Chinese goods. Once fentanyl tariffs are removed tariffs on Chinese goods will be only 10%. As a reference, tariffs on the U.S.\\'s best ally, the U.K., are also 10%. The U.S. runs a trade surplus with the U.K. and a massive trade deficit with China. According to our analysis, the probability of stagflation is now 60%, down from 70% prior. According to our analysis, the probability of a recession is now 35%, down from 40% prior.\\n\\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the deal with the E.U. will be \"a bit slower,\" but he is optimistic about trade deals with Asian countries.\\n\\nIgnore the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) this morning – the drop in DJIA is due to UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH suspending guidance.\\n\\nMagnificent Seven Money Flows\\n\\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), NVIDIA Corp (NVDA), and Tesla Inc (TSLA).\\n\\nIn the early trade, money flows are neutral in Apple Inc (AAPL).\\n\\nIn the early trade, money flows are negative in Microsoft Corp (MSFT).\\n\\nIn the early trade, money flows are positive in S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).\\n\\nMomo Crowd And Smart Money In Stocks\\n\\nInvestors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ. Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil. The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust GLD. The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust SLV. The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF USO.\\n\\nBitcoin\\n\\nBitcoin is seeing buying.\\n\\nThe crypto exchange company Coinbase Global Inc COIN is being added to the S&P 500. COIN will replace Discover Financial Services DFS on May 19. COIN is up about 11% as of this writing in the premarket.\\n\\nArora Protection Band And What To Do Now\\n\\nIt is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. our proprietary Protection Band puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors.\\n\\nConsider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.\\n\\nYou can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges. The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive. If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.\\n\\nA protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash. A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.\\n\\nIt is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks. High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.\\n\\nTraditional 60/40 Portfolio\\n\\nProbability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.\\n\\nThose who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less. Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.\\n\\nThe Arora Report is known for its accurate calls.

Apple has already appealed the ruling, and the analyst expects a long, drawn-out process. The key watchpoint is how quickly Apple can get a stay on the changes required by the latest ruling while pursuing the appeal process, the analyst said.\\n\\nHe noted the outcome during a long-drawn process could eventually see a fee lower than 27% to enable competition but materially higher than 0%, implying that Apple’s IP in its App Store is limited.\\n\\nChatterjee noted that the IP behind the App Store will have to be compensated; the latest court ruling effectively voids the value of the IP.\\n\\nPublishers or Applications, like Match, have said they saw a 1/3rd take rate on alternative payments offered on Google app stores, but those scenarios included payments within the App.\\n\\nAccording to the analyst, the cost of supporting transactions and discounts to promote link-out adoption will limit the economics for the vast majority of publishers.\\n\\nChatterjee’s scenario analysis implies modest EPS headwinds at most for Apple (2%-3%) if the company is unable to get a stay in the appeals process and an impact of ~80 to ~200 bps on the growth of Services revenue.\\n\\nPrice Action: AAPL stock is up 0.25% at $211.37 at last check Tuesday.\\n\\nLoading...

       "  'text': \"Virtual reality (VR) isn’t just a gamer’s fantasy anymore. Its market hit $53 billion in 2024, and forecasts project a surge to $557 billion by 2034, driven by declining headset costs and expanding applications in enterprise, healthcare, and education.\\n\\nConfident Investing Starts Here:\\n\\nQuickly and easily unpack a company's performance with TipRanks' new KPI Data for smart investment decisions\\n\\nReceive undervalued, market resilient stocks straight to you inbox with TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter\\n\\nAs digital immersion reshapes industries, Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) are positioning themselves as VR’s vanguard, each taking a distinct approach. Drawing from their latest earnings calls, commentary, and market developments, let’s dissect their VR-focused investment cases, weighing their strengths and risks in this transformative sector going from niche to mainstream rather quickly.\\n\\nSony PlayStation VR2 virtual reality kit at a Target store in Apex, North Carolina (April 2025)\\n\\nNvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) | The VR Backbone with Broad Reach\\n\\nNvidia doesn’t produce VR headsets, but its GPUs are the beating heart of immersive experiences. The Blackwell architecture, which raked in $11 billion in its latest quarter, powers the high-fidelity rendering VR demands, from gaming to industrial simulations. In recent commentary, CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the Omniverse platform’s role in 3D collaboration, noting its adoption by firms like Siemens (SIE) for virtual factory planning, a boon for VR content creators.\\n\\nThe unique thing about Nvidia is that its strength lies in its indirect exposure. Supplying chips and software to VR developers sidesteps the consumer headset market’s volatility. Of course, this broad focus means VR is just one slice of its $115 billion data center revenue. But that’s good, seeing as Nvidia generates sizable revenues from its more stable divisions. It can afford to invest heavily into VR research like few else can, which could mean VR-sector dominance in the years (and tech wars) to come.\\n\\nIs Nvidia a Buy, Sell, or Hold?\\n\\nCurrently, the overwhelming majority of analysts are bullish on NVDA stock. The stock features a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buy, four Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. NVDA’s average price target of $168.60 implies a ~38% upside over the next twelve months.\\n\\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) | Crafting VR’s Premium Future\\n\\nApple’s $3,500 “spatial computing” device, the Vision Pro, didn’t initially perform well. However, it seems that Apple believes it will find success by targeting professionals over casual users. In a recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook emphasized Apple’s VR traction with enterprises, citing use cases like virtual surgical training and architectural design. For instance, at Stanford Medicine, surgeons have integrated Vision Pro for real-time data visualization during procedures, enhancing precision in complex surgeries.\",\n",

In this article, we will undertake a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple AAPL in comparison to its major competitors within the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing crucial financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry.\\n\\nApple Background\\n\\nApple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.\\n\\nCompany P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 32.83 47.13 8 37.11% $32.25 $44.87 5.08% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 8.53 0.92 0.77 2.39% $1.11 $2.29 16.27% NetApp Inc 18.23 20.42 3.19 31.69% $0.45 $1.15 2.18% Super Micro Computer Inc 18.25 3.14 0.98 1.72% $0.4 $0.67 -18.99% Pure Storage Inc 172.06 13.36 5.77 3.12% $0.09 $0.59 11.4% Western Digital Corp 15.95 3.14 1.05 5.86% $0.28 $0.91 30.94% Eastman Kodak Co 12.69 0.87 0.52 -1.66% $0.02 $0.05 -0.8% Turtle Beach Corp 14.63 1.90 0.64 18.11% $0.03 $0.05 46.76% Average 37.19 6.25 1.85 8.75% $0.34 $0.82 12.54%\\n\\nBy thoroughly analyzing Apple, we can discern the following trends:\\n\\nAt 32.83 , the stock's Price to Earnings ratio is 0.88x less than the industry average, suggesting favorable growth potential.\\n\\nIt could be trading at a premium in relation to its book value, as indicated by its Price to Book ratio of 47.13 which exceeds the industry average by 7.54x .\\n\\nWith a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 8.0 , which is 4.32x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance.\\n\\nThe company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 37.11% , which is 28.36% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.\\n\\nThe company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.25 Billion , which is 94.85x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.\\n\\nCompared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $44.87 Billion , which indicates 54.72x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.\\n\\nThe company's revenue growth of 5.08% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 12.54%. This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance.\\n\\nDebt To Equity Ratio\\n\\nThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity.\\n\\nConsidering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.\\n\\nWhen evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise:\\n\\nIn the context of the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple holds a middle position among its top 4 peers.\\n\\nThis indicates a moderate level of debt relative to its equity with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.47, which implies a relatively balanced financial structure with a reasonable debt-equity mix.\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nFor Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is efficiently utilizing its resources and generating strong profits, despite slower revenue growth. Overall, Apple's financial performance is solid, with room for potential growth in the future.\\n\\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\",\n",

Meanwhile, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator prints a healthy 11.17 and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 64.77 — suggesting momentum without overheating.\\n\\nTo top it off, Tesla just confirmed a triple bottom formation, a technical pattern, repeatedly bouncing off the support at around $225. This technical chart pattern often precedes sustained bullish reversals. Charts indicate a clear bullish uptrend from here, with key support zones at $289 and $225.\\n\\nRobotaxi Dreams Vs. China Blues\\n\\nWhile Wall Street is fixated on Musk\\'s promised robotaxi debut in Austin next month — albeit with \"maybe 10–20 vehicles\" — China remains Tesla\\'s Achilles\\' heel. The company slid to eighth place in China\\'s new energy vehicle market in April, capturing just 3.2% share, down sharply from 7.5% in March.\\n\\nBYD Co Ltd BYDDF BYDDY continues to dominate the Chinese NEV space, posting a staggering 268,778 units sold in April.

Apple Inc AAPL, Nvidia Corp NVDA and Amazon.com Inc AMZN are also members.\\n\\nThe bigger surprise is just how fast sentiment flipped.

       "  'text': \"The Oracle of Omaha's legacy boils down to a simplified approach that anyone can use.\\n\\nWarren Buffett capped a legendary career recently when he announced that he would be stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year. The multibillionaire and all-time investing great spent six decades leading the holding company to success, which grew into one of the world's largest companies.\\n\\nBuffett is known for his long-term investment philosophies and willingness to hold winning stocks, even if they become significant portions of his portfolio. Just four winning stocks make up 57% of Berkshire Hathaway's $277 billion stock portfolio. Here they are, and why they are still excellent buy-and-hold candidates for any long-term investor.\\n\\n1. Apple: Current value of Berkshire's stake: $59.5 billion\\n\\nBuffett has referred to personal electronics giant Apple (AAPL -0.69%) as Berkshire's best business. Berkshire first bought the iPhone maker in 2016, and despite ringing the cash register a bit last year for a considerable profit, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding. In Berkshire's latest shareholder meeting, Buffett even joked that Apple CEO Tim Cook, who personally attended the meeting, has made Berkshire more money than he ever did.\\n\\nPeople depend on smartphones and other personal devices to communicate, surf the web, pay bills, and more. Apple's iOS ecosystem has become a juggernaut, with over 2.35 billion active devices worldwide. It's an ideal distribution channel through which Apple sells subscription services and collects fees on its App Store.\\n\\nApple, worth $3 trillion today, may not grow as it once did, but its staggering profitability and size enable jaw-dropping stock buybacks that set a pretty high floor for the stock.\\n\\n2. American Express: Current value of Berkshire's stake: $43.1 billion\\n\\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly praised the U.S. economy over the years. The American consumer is the U.S. economy's beating heart. Credit cards can get borrowers into financial trouble, but debt is a cultural staple in a country with over $1.2 trillion in total credit card debt.\\n\\nAmerican Express (AXP -0.59%) is a credit card company, bank, and payment processor with roots dating back to the 1800s. Today, the company is known for catering to high earners and businesses.\\n\\nAmerican Express is one of Berkshire's longest-standing holdings. Buffett purchased the stock for Berkshire in 1991 and has owned it since. American Express is likely not going anywhere as long as it is a financial staple in the world's largest economy.\\n\\nThe company's management has also noted success in winning over Gen Z and millennial consumers, who will carry the mantle of American consumerism over the coming decades. That makes the stock a no-brainer to buy and hold.\\n\\n3. Bank of America: Current value of Berkshire's stake: $28.4 billion\\n\\nBuffett allegedly came up with the idea to invest in America's second-largest bank, Bank of America (BAC 1.35%), while soaking in the bathtub.\\n\\nBerkshire struck a deal to buy preferred shares and stock warrants in 2011, ultimately cashing in and building a position in common shares in 2017. A bank stock like Bank of America, which has over $3.3 trillion in total assets, offers broad exposure to the economy because Bank of America deals in everything from commercial real estate to financial markets and mortgages.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that Bank of America may not be for everyone because bank stocks are sensitive to interest rates and recessions. Additionally, the reason Buffett's Bank of America investment worked out so well is primarily because he negotiated a deal that few individual investors would realistically have the ability or resources to do.\\n\\nStill, Buffett has continued to hold Bank of America as one of Berkshire's most prominent holdings, a clear vote of confidence that helps it stand out among other banks.\\n\\n4. Coca-Cola: Current value of Berkshire's stake: $28.2 billion\\n\\nGlobal beverage behemoth Coca-Cola (KO 0.41%) is arguably the most famous Warren Buffett stock. There are countless photos of Buffett enjoying Coca-Cola products over the years. Berkshire first bought the stock in 1988, and it has been a model of consistency for the portfolio.\\n\\nIt's not the fastest-growing company you can invest in, but it has steadily grown for generations. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive annual dividend raises. Berkshire's stake pays out over $800 million in dividends annually!\\n\\nWill that stop anytime soon? Don't count on it. Coca-Cola doesn't grow very fast, but it has virtually endless growth opportunities in a global economy with over 8 billion people. The beverage market is highly fragmented, so Coca-Cola can launch new products or acquire emerging competitors when needed.\\n\\nAdd it all up, and Coca-Cola is the tortoise that will slowly make you rich if you buy and hold it for decades, as Buffett and Berkshire have done.\",\n",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other buzzing stocks after latest earnings season.\\n\\nMarkets were cheering the latest US-China trade deal, after which the two countries will significantly reduce tariffs on each other’s imports for 90 days. The deal practically negates all bear cases modeled by Wall Street analysts based on the impact of tariffs.\\n\\nSylvia Jablonski, Defiance ETFs CEO and CIO, called the deal a “game changer” during a program on CNBC.\\n\\n“I think both countries probably saw a little bit of the demise of what would be here with a non-tariff deal as the data came in. You had a lot of complaints around China across all sectors and then in the US, retailers were reaching out to President Trump and saying that shelves are empty and, you know, a lot of panic about semiconductor software companies. I think that this is really a game changer for both countries, and the big message here is that both countries, it sounds like, decided that they really don’t want to decouple, and, you know, make America great might also mean that, you know, China stays.”\\n\\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In.\\n\\nFor this article, we picked 10 stocks currently making moves amid the latest earnings season.

       "  'text': \"Apple (AAPL -0.69%) has been the defining big tech stock over the past decade. For most of that time, it has reigned as the world's largest company, although Microsoft currently holds that title. However, I think there is a strong chance that a few companies could surpass Apple in terms of market cap over the next five years.\\n\\nThe contenders should come as no surprise, as it's going to take an already large company to pass up Apple. The three I think have a strong chance of doing it are Nvidia (NVDA 3.49%), Amazon (AMZN -0.93%), and Alphabet (GOOG 3.42%) (GOOGL 3.39%).\\n\\nA lot can happen in three years, but I think the odds are high that these three are larger than Apple during that time frame.\\n\\n1. Nvidia\\n\\nNvidia is probably the biggest layup in this group, as it only trails Apple by about $100 billion in terms of valuation. While that sounds like a huge number (and it is), it indicates that Nvidia stock needs to rise about 3.5% to pass Apple. However, I believe that Nvidia will create an insurmountable valuation lead over Apple in the next five years.\\n\\nNvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the data center market and are the top pick for running AI models. The industry is a long way from the data center buildout being complete, and Nvidia projects that data center capital expenditures will rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. Nvidia makes a ton of money from these builds, so massive growth from its primary market will propel Nvidia higher.\\n\\nWall Street analysts project 54% and 23% revenue growth for Nvidia in FY 2026 and FY 2027, while Apple's estimates are 4% and 6% growth in FY 2025 and FY 2026. Nvidia's superior growth will vault it ahead of Apple, securing its place as either the world's largest or second-largest company.\\n\\n2. Amazon\\n\\nAmazon has a much trickier road ahead with tariffs affecting many of the goods sold on its platform that come from China, which is currently subject to a hefty tariff rate. However, that's the wrong way to assess Amazon stock.\\n\\nInstead, investors should look at where the profits come from. In Q1, 63% of Amazon's operating profits came from its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This division also saw impressive growth, with revenue rising 17% in the quarter and operating profits increasing 23%.\\n\\nCompanywide, Amazon's revenue rose 9% year over year, with operating profits increasing 20%. This will become the status quo for Amazon, as its higher-margin businesses are growing much faster than some of its larger divisions that don't have as great of margins. As a result, Amazon's operating margins are steadily ticking up.\\n\\nThis strong growth rate is much faster than Apple's, and this trend will eventually allow Amazon to surpass Apple over the next five years.\\n\\n3. Alphabet\\n\\nLast is Alphabet, which is an interesting pick for this list. Alphabet has been found guilty of operating an illegal monopoly in its Google search engine and advertising business. To further complicate matters, Eddy Cue, Apple's senior vice president of services, testified in federal court that he believes AI search engines will replace products like Google.\\n\\nThis caused Alphabet shares to sink following the news, but it's nothing that investors (or Google) didn't already know. Alphabet has already worked to integrate AI-powered search summaries at the top of each Google search, so it's already preparing for this change. Furthermore, Cue mentioned that Apple was planning to add AI search options from various AI competitors, which means Alphabet wouldn't need to pay Apple $20 billion as the default search engine.\\n\\nIf Alphabet had that $20 billion back and Apple didn't receive it, that would be a massive swing in profits toward Alphabet's direction, despite Alphabet already generating more profits than Apple.\\n\\nIf both companies received the same valuation, Alphabet would already be worth more than Apple. Now, if Apple loses $20 billion of pure profit paid to it by Alphabet and Alphabet gets to keep it, these numbers become even more skewed toward Alphabet's favor.\\n\\nThere's still a lot of risk in Alphabet's stock due to a potential breakup or Google losing the AI search race. But if it emerges alright from those two events, it has the potential to overtake Apple in terms of valuation.\",\n",

Earlier this month, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that Cook had discussed the potential of relocating iPhone production to the U.S. This conversation aligns with the Trump administration’s push for Apple to shift device production to the U.S.\\n\\nOn an earnings call, Cook discussed Apple\\'s tariff strategy with investors, stating that the company is currently sourcing products bound for the U.S. from manufacturing sites in Vietnam and India. However, he refrained from making projections beyond June, describing the situation as \"difficult to predict.\"\\n\\nFurthermore, amid ongoing trade tensions, recent reports indicate that Apple has been contemplating raising the prices for its forthcoming fall iPhone models. However, the tech giant is keen to dismiss any notion that a possible price increase is tied to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, where most of its devices are assembled.\\n\\nThe tariff suspension resulted in a 6.3% increase in Apple’s stock on Monday.

       "  'text': \"New York CNN —\\n\\nUS stocks surged on Monday after President Donald Trump’s top trade officials brokered a surprisingly dramatic de-escalation in trade tensions with China over the weekend, dropping tariffs to much lower levels, which some economists say could stave off a US recession.\\n\\nThe Dow closed higher by 1,161 points, or 2.81%. The broader S&P 500 gained 3.26%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite surged 4.35%. The three major indexes each posted their biggest single-day gains in over one month.\\n\\n“The sharp market rally today reflects the unexpectedly positive tariff news,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services, in a Monday note. “Many investors were not positioned for this outcome, leading to a significant market surge.”\\n\\nThe Nasdaq, which had entered a bear market on April 4, closed up more than 20% from its lowest point this year — exiting its bear market and marking the start of a new bull market. (A rise of 20% from a recent low generally marks a bull market.)\\n\\nIt’s been a swift recovery in recent weeks for the Nasdaq, though the index is still down about 3.1% this year.\\n\\nMarkets cheer easing trade tensions\\n\\nUS stocks on Monday firmly erased all their losses since Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” trade announcement, which placed a 10% tariff on practically all goods coming into the United States and set significantly higher tariffs on dozens of countries. Trump paused most of those tariffs just days after they went into effect but jacked up import taxes on China — eventually to 145% on most Chinese imports.\\n\\nIn turn, China hiked tariffs on US goods to 125%. The tit-for-tat trade war had effectively stopped trade between the two countries, risking substantial price hikes and shortages.\\n\\nTrump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent both had said in recent weeks that tariffs on China had grown unsustainably high and a détente was necessary. But few believed that the result of the discussions between Bessent, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and their Chinese counterparts in Geneva this weekend was going to be quite so significant.\\n\\nBoth sides agreed to axe tariffs by 115 percentage points, still leaving the levies considerably higher than where they were before Trump took office in January — but much, much lower than the historic level over the past month that deeply concerned American businesses, consumers, economists and investors.\\n\\n“No one had these low China tariff rates on their bingo cards,” said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial, in an email. “This is a big positive surprise.”\\n\\nAnother key element of the discussions: Bessent said the US and China had put in place a mechanism to avoid raising tariffs on each other again, suggesting that the worst of the trade war may be behind us.\\n\\nTrump said as much during a Monday press conference. When asked if the tariffs on Chinese exports would snap back to 145% if there were to be an impasse on trade talks, Trump said, “No.”\\n\\n“No, but they would go up substantially higher” than the 30% rate during the pause, he said. “I think you will have a deal, however.”\\n\\nTraders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Richard Drew/AP\\n\\nThe de-escalation of US-China tariffs further reduces global recession risks, Henry Allen, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to investors Monday morning.\\n\\n“The market’s resilience itself is making a recession less likely by easing financial conditions,” he wrote. “And policymakers don’t want a downturn or market turmoil either, as we saw with the 90-day extension to the reciprocal tariffs.”\\n\\nAs a result, Wall Street cheered Monday morning. Investors showed greater appetite for riskier assets, including stocks. The US dollar rose 1.4% against a basket of currencies. US oil, which had tumbled as investors feared a demand vacuum because of a tariff-induced global recession, surged 1.52% to $61.95 a barrel. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.64% to $64.96 a barrel.\\n\\nBy contrast, investors sold off save-haven assets, such as gold, which tumbled 2.7%. US Treasuries also fell, sending the 10-year yield back above 4.45%. Bond prices and yields trade in opposite directions. Japan’s yen fell 2% against the dollar.\\n\\nThe CBOE Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, sank more than 15% to its lowest level since the end of March. “Greed” was the sentiment driving markets, according to CNN’s Fear and Greed index. The index had been staunchly in “extreme fear” and “fear” this year before surging into “greed” this month.\\n\\n“The larger-than-expected drop in the tariffs between the US and China, while temporary, and the establishment of a framework for continued discussion, is exactly what the stock market was hoping to see,” said Carol Schleif, chief market strategist at BMO Private Wealth.\\n\\nTech stocks were particular winners on Monday: Despite a recent US carveout for hardware from tariffs on China, tech had been rocked in particular by the trade war between the US and China, because of the deeply intertwined relationship between American and Chinese technology sectors. Apple (AAPL) gained 6.3%, Tesla (TSLA) rose 6.75%, Nvidia (NVDA) was up 5.4%, Amazon (AMZN) rose 8.1% and Intel (INTC) was up 3.55%.\\n\\nStocks of luxury goods makers, which had tumbled in recent months, bounced back sharply: Hermes rose 3.5%, Burberry was up 3.67% and LVMH surged 7%.\\n\\nAutomakers also surged: Jeep and Chrysler maker Stellantis (STLA) was up 6.5%, General Motors (GM) rose 4.4% and Ford (F) was up 2.6%.\\n\\n“The risk-on move in markets suggests that investors had not expected such a positive outcome to come so quickly,” said Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi, chief investment officer for global equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a Monday note. “Investors will now be focused on signs that the temporary fix can be turned into a lasting agreement.”\\n\\nA bad time for a trade war\\n\\nBessent on Monday morning characterized the trade war de-escalation that he helped negotiate this weekend with his Chinese counterparts as tough but respectful.\\n\\n“We were firm, and we moved forward,” Bessent told CNBC from Geneva. “We tried to identify shared interest. We came with a list of problems that we were trying to solve, and I think we did a good job on that.”\\n\\nBessent noted that America was negotiating from a position of strength because China needs the United States to buy its products more than the US relies on China for its goods exports. China’s economy is on the ropes, amid a housing crisis and an emerging debt crisis. Consumer spending has fallen, as has factory output. This is a bad time for China to be dealing with a crippling trade war.\\n\\n“I had seen what’s going on in the Chinese economy. We can see what’s going on with the shipments to the US,” Bessent said. “Again, we are the (trade) deficit country.\\n\\nHistorically, the deficit is a country has a better negotiating position.”\\n\\nBut, as the saying goes, no one wins in a trade war. US consumer sentiment fell off a cliff in recent months as inflation-weary Americans grew anxious about the prospect of rising prices and shortages. Shipments to the US from China were all but halted, rattling corporate America. And investors had braced for a recession, as economists said the US economy could get hit particularly hard by the trade war.\\n\\nContainers are seen at the port in Lianyungang, in China's eastern Jiangsu province, on May 1. AFP/Getty Images\\n\\nThe detente, though welcome by Wall Street, consumers and businesses, represents a remarkable shift for a Trump administration that only days ago had said the trade standoff with China was necessary to restore America’s lost manufacturing prowess. Trump had said last week that zero trade with China put America in a stronger position, because that meant it was no longer “losing money” to the Chinese.\\n\\nBessent said the deal didn’t represent a major policy shift, however.\\n\\n“This is just a pause,” he said. “The April 2 tariff level for China was 34%, so we have moved that down from 34% to 10%.”\\n\\nAs the next step in negotiating, the US will focus on expanding its supply chains for what Bessent called “strategic necessities,” reducing its reliance on China for things like critical medicines, semiconductor chips and steel.\\n\\n“What we do want is a decoupling for strategic necessities, which we were unable to obtain during Covid,” he said. “And we realized that efficient supply chains were not resilient supply chains. So, we are going to create our own.”\\n\\nHe also said the US would seek a fairer approach to international business. Bessent said the Trump administration wants to break down “insidious, non-tariff trade barriers that hurt American companies trying to do business” in other countries.\\n\\nA “historic fresh start”\\n\\nThe trade war de-escalation with China represents a big win for the US economy and the American consumer, Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council of the United States, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan Monday.\\n\\nHassett said Trump had scored major concessions from China and the United Kingdom in their respective recent frameworks for trade negotiations, announced over the past few days, particularly by opening up the UK market to American beef and potentially paring back some of the barriers China had put in place on American companies looking to do business there. And Hassett suggested the agreement reached over the weekend should prevent further issues with supply shocks from China.\\n\\n“A lot of that is cleared up now — the potential for supply disruptions from China,” Hassett said. “I think it’s really a very historic fresh start in the relationship between the US and China.”\\n\\nBut Hassett said the recent turn of events is not a contradiction in Trump’s prior policy.\\n\\n“The bottom line is what President Trump was saying was that if we don’t work out that good deal, we’ll be fine,” Hassett said. “The fact is that we didn’t sell practically anything to China. We’re buying a lot of stuff from China. We could buy that stuff from other countries, or make it ourselves.”\",\n",

It will also help reinforce the company\\'s commitment to 7% to 9% annual dividend growth and $1 billion stock buybacks , it said in the press release.\\n\\n\"Assuming approval, the acquisition positions NRG as one of the largest U.S. natural gas generators, providing opportunities to capitalize on rising power demand trends, in our view,\" says CFRA Research analyst Daniel Rich (Buy).',\n",

       "  'text': 'In a market whipsawed by AI hype, tariff fears and geopolitical headlines, today\\'s traders are not committing – they\\'re swiping right on volatility and moving fast. The most active market participants are increasingly using leveraged and inverse ETFs to play quick, high-conviction moves – not long-term narratives, Jake Behan, head of Capital Markets at Direxion, told Benzinga in an exclusive Q&A email.\\n\\nA case in point: Palantir Technologies Inc PLTR. After a solid earnings report in May, its stock plunged over 12% as investors questioned whether the company\\'s AI-fueled growth spurt was sustainable. That didn\\'t stop flows.

Traders are watching everything from Chinese demand to AI monetization to capital expenditure trends – but they\\'re expressing those views tactically. Direxion\\'s single-stock suite saw massive action around earnings and tariffs, with $3.6 billion in inflows in April alone, led by the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3x Shares SOXL, its 3X bull semiconductor ETF.\\n\\nMeanwhile, traditional hedges are falling out of favor. Instead, traders are deploying -1X ETFs as quick hedging tools, especially during headline-sensitive windows, notes Behan. This is visible in inverse funds like the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3x Shares SOXS, Direxion Daily AAPL Bear 1X Shares AAPD and Direxion Daily FTSE China Bear 3x Shares YANG, which saw weekly inflows during tariff-related drawdowns and macro data surprises.\\n\\nLooking ahead, Behan isn\\'t expecting a calm summer. \"We\\'re likely to see more storms of volatility,\" he warns, pointing to the expiration of the current 90-day tariff reprieve and the next round of earnings.\\n\\nEpisodic spikes – not a high VIX regime – could define the market mood.\\n\\nThe upside surprise?\\n\\nAccording to Behan, if labor and inflation data fall into line, the market could be forced to price in resilient growth, not just risk.
